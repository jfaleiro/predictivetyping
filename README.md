# predictive typing::preliminary analysis

Exploratory analysis of english words based on markov chains and n-grams.

The goal here is to explain major features of the data we have identified and briefly summarize our plans for creating a prediction algorithm for the next English word you will type, in different devices in different types of media (twitter, blogs and news feeds).

This is intended as a short summary, i.e. pre-processing of data and extraction of preliminary features as a preparation of the prediction algorithm to be used.

This report is fully reproducible. Execution on a local environment will cause the installation of required libraries and dependencies.

To see the results you can check the [published report](http://rpubs.com/jfaleiro/text-prediction-preliminary-analysis), or the `knitr` [markup](index.md).
